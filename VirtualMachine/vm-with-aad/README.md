# Deploy a virtual machine that provides AAD sign-in capability.

This template allows you to deploy a simple Windows VM that supports AAD Sign-in capability. Previously when needing to use AAD account to log into an Azure VM you would have to manually join it as a device into AAD.  With the public preview, when creating a new virtual machine you are given the ability to use AAD.
